# Discord.py-self Beginner Ground Docs

## Introduction

My very own documentation for beginners trying to learn about self botting, as said in the title, this is a beginner ground so it doesn't cover everything in the library nor anything that isn't directly correlated to discord.py-self

- **Discord Self-Bots are indeed against TOS, it may risk your account getting banned**
    - *I am not responsible if you're account gets banned, please don't come after me if it does please :3*

- **This documentation may not be what you're looking for, but it includes further examples from the already made [discord.py-self documenation](https://discordpy-self.readthedocs.io), class explanations and their attributes, and parameter usage**
    - *In terms of classes, attributes types that are **bools**, **str**, or **int** are skipped due to their simplicity*


*Python is probably one of the closest programming languages to English, and discord.py-self has the best of it, so it's much easier to decipher from an understanding standpoint* <br>
<br>
**Keep in mind, if you try to run some of the code, it won't always work since they are examples** <br>
<br>
**If you were wondering how discord.py-self or even discord.py works, they're called API wrappers, your token has an authorization specifically to your account and discord.com/api/v{#} is the url to which controls the different things of your account whether it's your user or the guilds you're in. API wrappers make it more straightforward to control that account, for example, if you wanted to send a message, you'd have to make your own definition for sending the message using your authorization and the api link, so you might as well use an already made wrapper, *shrug* **
